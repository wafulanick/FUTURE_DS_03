# FUTURE_DS_03

✅ Clean and prepare feedback data (from a Google Form export)

✅ Analyze ratings (1–5 scale) to find patterns of satisfaction

✅ Use NLP tools to score sentiment in comments (positive/neutral/negative)

✅ Visualize trends with beautiful charts and graphs

✅ Suggest improvements for future events

1. How well versed with the subjects were the teachers?
 
The average feedback by the students stands at approximately 7.5. This provides that the teachers' level of awareness of the subjects they teach is quite impressive. This shows a uniform distribution since al the ratings are between 5 and 10, with a KDE overlay that shows no strong skew. The visualization is right-skewed; therefore, the majority of the students perceive that the teachers were well-versed in their subjects.

Recommendations 

Therefore, the teachers should maintain the current standards of teaching; however, we may consider identifying and also rewarding top-performing teachers to boost their morale even more. 
Some students, however, think that the teachers were ill-prepared. 

Recommendation

We therefore recommend that an investigation should be carried out on such cases. If at all it comes out as being a specific teacher or subject, we can perform mentorship and /or training for them to scale up their teaching. 

2. Did the teachers explain the concepts in an understandable way?

The average student feedback provides that the level with which the teachers understandably delivered their content is at 6.082, which is slightly above the average of 5. The boxen plot, however, suggests a broadly distributed perception without any clear consensus 
towards any extreme. Nonetheless, with most responses falling between 4 and 8, we can conclude that the teachers explained the concepts in an understandable way. There is a higher concentration of feedback between 4 and 8.

Recommendation 

This provides that student understood the concepts very well. Therefore, we recommend that the current teaching methods be maintained. Additionally, such could also be shared across other departments. 
We also noted that there are several low outliers, 1 and 2's. This suggests that some students really struggled to understand. 

Recommendation 

We therefore recommend that we identify specific teachers and advise them to consider doing a follow-up tutorial or mentorships for them to ensure improvement. 

3. Did the teachers use presentations in their delivery?

The average student feedback is slightly above average, at 5.94, showing that the teachers did  actually use the presentations. The Histogram shows that the student counts based on their responses were significant numbers, all  above 150. 
Additionally, the kde curve suggests as multi-modal distribution with no strong central tendency. 
This shows that there were various levels of frequency regarding the use of presentations.  The majority of the feedback received falls within the range of 5 to 7. This provides that  presentations are used quite inconsistently.

Recommendation

We can consider offering training to the teachers on effective presentation designs and how important it is to integrate such into lessons 

4. What was the degree of difficulty of the assignments issued by the teachers?

The box plot shows a mean of the feedback received as 5.43, with the majority of the feedback being above the average value, between 5 and 8. It also shows outliers of 1 and 10. It provides that the assignments issued to them had a high difficulty rate 
Students have mixed reactions concerning this.

Recommendation 

Given that the majority of the feedback lies between 4 and 8, consider either; 
1. Maintaining or refining the level of difficulty based on the students' performances 
2. Review this to ensure clarity is attained, a proper structure is maintained, and to lighten 
the workload on the students
